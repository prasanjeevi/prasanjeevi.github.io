# Computer Program Design
- Elizabeth A. Dickson - Tata McGraw-Hill

Teaches how to plan out program solutions to problems.

Most of us like to do things more than we like _planning_ the doing. We would rather take a vacation than read travel books about a vacation.

The urge to jump in and do something leads to all kinds of complications.

Coding and executing a program is one way to test to see if a program will work, but it's a pretty inefficient way. You wouldn't think much of an architect who designed a building, but couldn't tell you if the building would stand up without actually building it. We need to be able to test our program logic without having to "build" the program.

## Program Development Cycle
* Review the specifications
* Informal Design
  * List major tasks
  * List subtasks, sub-subtasks and so on
* Formal Desgin (Pseudocode and Flowcharts)
  * Create formal design from task lists
  * Desk check design
* Code and compile the program
* Test and if necessary, debug the program
* Use and as necessary, maintain the program

The rough sketches probably wouldn't be enough for a builder or another architect to know what is planned. The blueprints or formal design, utilize a standard form for communicating the plan.

Desk checking is the way to check the logic of your design.
